Getting started with Hugo for a personal blog:

1. Create a github repo for your content: with the name `<username>.github.io`
2. Initialize the repo with Hugo using the quick start instructions here: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/
3. Setup the repo to publish to the `gh-pages` branch using the Github workflow here: https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/
4. Configure the actions-gh-pages deploy key as shown here: https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages#%EF%B8%8F-create-ssh-deploy-key
5. Now make sure to go back to the `Pages` section of your repo & set the branch to `gh-pages`, this will point the github action at your deploy branch.
6. Finally, once the page is up and deploying successfully you can follow the instructions here to setup a custom domain with Namecheap: https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9645/2208/how-do-i-link-my-domain-to-github-pages/
